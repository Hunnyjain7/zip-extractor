    <em>Extract all the zips from the root directory having a nested directories.</em>

## Problem
* Basically Extracting a zip is a easy task but the problem he is that how much deep we need to go inside a directory.

## Recursive Approach
* To Solve this problem i took a recursive approach.
-- Itrating over a directory and then using recursion by calling the same function to agiain itrate over directory, this will take us deep to the directory and identify a zip to extract it.
